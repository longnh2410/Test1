ABPadLockScreen provides a simple keypad style unlock feature for your app. The classes use delegation to obtain necessary 
data and instruct the delegate of important events.

To use in your app:
1. Copy all the files in the ABPadLockScreen folder into your apps source folder
2. Add the files into your Xcode project
3. Simply import the ABPadLockScreen.h file and use as required

To view a demo of the ABPadLockScreen in action, as well as an example of how to use the class, have a look through the 
ABPadLockScreenDemo project.
